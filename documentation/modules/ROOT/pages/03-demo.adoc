[NOTE]
====
* The `ilab config init` command is used to initialize the InstructLab configuration, creating the `config.yaml` file with the default configuration.
* The user is prompted to provide the necessary values to initialize the environment, such as the path to the taxonomy repo and the path to the model.
* After running ilab config init your directories will look like the following on a Linux system:
** ~/.cache/instructlab/models/ (1)
** ~/.local/share/instructlab/datasets (2)
** ~/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy (3)
** ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints (4)

(1) Directory where the models are stored.
(2) Directory where the datasets are stored.
(3) Directory where the taxonomy is stored.
(4) Directory where the checkpoints are stored.
====

To enable external access to your model, please modify the `config.yaml` file, located into your `instructlab` directory:  `~/.config/instructlab/config.yaml`. This change needs to be done under the `serve` section, as shown below:

[.source,yaml]
----
host_port: 0.0.0.0:8000
----

[NOTE]
====
* The `host_port: The IP address and port where the model will be exposed. In this case, the model will be exposed on all interfaces.
====

Before starting the server, download the model to be used by the chatbot. The `ilab download` command is used to download the model to be used by the chatbot. Run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ilab model download
----

[NOTE]
====
* The `ilab download` command is used to download the model to be used by the chatbot.
====

Now, start the server that will be responsible for receiving the user input, sending it to the model, and sending the response back to the user. The `ilab model serve` command is used to start the server. Run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----

[#_public_skupper_deployment]
== Public Skupper Deployment

Deploy the public Skupper in Openshift Cluster. The public Skupper will receive the connection from the private Skupper and create a secure connection between the two sites.

=== Creating the project and deploying the public Skupper:

This is the step where you create the project and deploy the public Skupper. The public Skupper will be responsible for receiving the connection from the private Skupper and creating a secure connection between the two sites. Open a new terminal and run the following commands:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
export SKUPPER_PLATFORM=kubernetes
oc new-project ilab-pilot
skupper init --enable-console --enable-flow-collector --console-user admin --console-password admin
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Run this command in a new terminal and keep it open, because the default platform is `kubernetes` and the private terminal is using `podman`.
====

[NOTE]
====
* `SKUPPER_PLATFORM=kubernetes` is used to set the platform to Kubernetes. This is necessary because the public Skupper will be running on a Kubernetes cluster.
* `oc new-project ilab-pilot` is used to create a new project called `ilab-pilot` in the OpenShift cluster.
* `skupper init` is used to initialize the Skupper network, setting up the necessary components to enable secure communication between services.
* The `--enable-console` flag is used to enable the Skupper console, which provides a web interface for managing the Skupper network.
* The `--enable-flow-collector` flag is used to enable the flow collector, which collects and displays information about the traffic flowing through the Skupper network.
* The `--console-user admin` flag is used to set the username for the Skupper console to `admin`.
* The `--console-password admin` flag is used to set the password for the Skupper console to `admin`.
====

=== Creating the token to allow the private Skupper to connect to the public Skupper:

This is the step where you create the token to allow the private Skupper to connect to the public Skupper. At the same terminal, run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
skupper token create token.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
* `skupper token create token.yaml` is used to generate a connection token that can be used by other sites to link to the Skupper network, ensuring secure communication.
* The `token.yaml` file will contain the token to connect the two sites.
====

Now, you'll have a `token.yaml` file with the token to connect the two sites.

[#_private_skupper_deployment]
== Private Skupper Deployment

The second step is to deploy the private Skupper in Private Local Environment. The private Skupper will be responsible for creating a secure connection between the two sites, allowing the Ollama Pilot application to send requests to the InstructLab chat model. 

=== Install Skupper

To install skupper on site A, with podman as the platform, open a new terminal to handle all the commands related to the private Skupper. Here, we will create a skuper site using podman as the platform, we need to enable the podan service before running the skupper init command:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
----

[NOTE]
====
* `systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket` is used to enable and start the podman service at the user level.
====

Now, run the following commands to install Skupper:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
export SKUPPER_PLATFORM=podman
skupper init --ingress none
----

[NOTE]
====
* `SKUPPER_PLATFORM=podman` is used to set the platform to podman. This is necessary because the private Skupper will be running on a podman container.
* `skupper init` is used to initialize the Skupper network, setting up the necessary components to enable secure communication between services.
* The `--ingress none` flag is used to disable the automatic creation of an ingress controller. This is necessary because the public Skupper will be responsible for exposing the service to the internet.
====

=== Exposing the InstructLab Chat Model

To bind the local service running the InstructLab chat model to the Skupper service:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
skupper expose host <YOUR MACHINE IP> --address instructlab --port 8000
----

[NOTE]
====
* `skupper expose` is used to expose a local service through the Skupper network, allowing it to be accessed from other Skupper-connected sites.
* `host <YOUR MACHINE IP>` is used to specify the IP address of the machine where the service is running.
* `--address instructlab` is used to specify the address of the service.
* `--port 8000` is used to specify the port of the service.
====

Check the status of the Skupper service:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
skupper service status

Services exposed through Skupper:
â•°â”€ instructlab:8000 (tcp)
----

[NOTE]
====
* `skupper service status` is used to display the status of services exposed through Skupper, showing what is accessible and how itâ€™s connected within the network.
====

=== Secure Communication Between the Two Sites with Skupper

Now it's time to establish a secure connection between the two sites using the token created by the public Skupper. Using the token created by the public Skupper, run the following command at the terminal where the private Skupper is running:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
skupper link create token.yaml --name instructlab
----

[NOTE]
====
* `skupper link create token.yaml --name instructlab` is used to establish a secure link between two Skupper sites using the token created by `skupper token`.
====

Check the status of the Skupper link:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
skupper link status

Links created from this site:

        Link instructlab is connected

Current links from other sites that are connected:

        There are no connected links
----

[NOTE]
====
* `skupper link status` is used to display the status of the links created by the Skupper network, showing which sites are connected and how they are connected.
====

Check the status on the public Skupper terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
skupper link status

Links created from this site:

       There are no links configured or connected

Current links from other sites that are connected:

       Incoming link from site b8ad86d5-9680-4fea-9c07-ea7ee394e0bd
----

[NOTE]
====
* `skupper link status` is used to display the status of the links created by the Skupper network, showing which sites are connected and how they are connected.
====

=== Chatbot with Protected Data

The last step is to expose the service in the public Skupper and create the Ollama Pilot application.

* Still on the terminal where the **public** Skupper is running, run the following command to expose the service:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
skupper service create instructlab 8000
----

[NOTE]
====
* `skupper service create instructlab 8000` is used to create the service in the public Skupper, allowing it to be accessed from the private Skupper.
====

[#_deploying_instructlab_chatbot]
== Deploying the InstructLab Chatbot

Before run the chatbot, let's understand the final part of this solution, the Frontend application.

This application will be deployed in a OpenShift cluster, and will be responsible for sending the user input to the InstructLab chat model and displaying the response to the user. The application will be deployed at the same namespace where the public Skupper is running.


[IMPORTANT]
====
* The frontend application called ILAB Frontend chatbot will use the local service in the public cluster to send the user input to the InstructLab chat model and display the response to the user. See the line 23 of the `ilab-client-deployment.yaml` file.

To interact with the chatbot, you can access the public URL of the ILAB Frontend chatbot using a web browser. The chatbot will be displayed on the screen, and you can start interacting with it by typing messages in the chat window.

image::chat_bot.png[Chatbot]

[#_considerations]
=== Considerations

* If your machine has an Nvidia GPU, you can use the InstructLab chat model to generate responses to user input. The InstructLab chat model is a large language model trained on the Merlinite dataset and is capable of generating human-like responses to user input. By following the steps outlined in this demonstration, you can deploy the InstructLab chat model in your environment and interact with it using the ILAB Frontend chatbot. This will allow you to experience the power of generative AI models and see how they can be used to create engaging and interactive applications.
* Adjust the model temperature to control the randomness of the responses generated by the chatbot. A lower temperature will result in more deterministic responses, while a higher temperature will result in more random responses. Experiment with different temperature values to find the right balance between coherence and creativity in the chatbot's responses.
